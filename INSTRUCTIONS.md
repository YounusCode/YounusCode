Usage Instructions
Fork this repo and name it <your-username>
In your forked repo, go to the Settings tab > actions > general. In the Workflow permissions section, toggle Read and Write permissions and press save. This will allow for the snake contributions svg to be generated based on your own contributions via Github Actions.
Go to the Actions tab, select Generate Snake and click run workflow. That way, you will manually generate your first snake svg; after that, a new one will be generated every 12 hours.
On line 1, rename page_id url param to <your-username>.<your-username>
On line 5, rename lines url param to whatever you`d like
Customize lines 9-23 to fit your description
Customize your Socials section (25-35)
Customize your Tools section (41-46)
On line 54, change /salesp07/salesp07/ to /<your-username>/<your-username>/. This will make sure that you're fetching your snake contributions svg and not mine.
In your stats section, rename https://github-readme-salesp07.vercel.app to https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app. The first one is my private instance of the repo, and I use it so my private contributions are taken into account as well. Hosting your private instance of github-readme-stats on Vercel is quite a simple process; if you're interested, click here.
Customize your footer typing animation (line 79)
